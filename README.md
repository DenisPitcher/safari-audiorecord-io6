Audio Recording into iOS6 Safari
=====

This hack lets you record audio into a web app on iOS6 Safari. It's very much a hack, but it's as good a hack as any, in that the iOS6 Specification launched in September doesn't allow for audio recording, despite allowing photo and video recording. This implementation takes audio from a video and runs ffmpeg (static Linux build bundled) to extract the audio.
